## Slide 1: Title Slide (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
"Good evening, fellow Toastmasters and guests! Welcome back to our elephant-eating journey. Last week, we learned that the secret to consuming any massive challenge isn't superhuman willpower - it's taking tiny, atomic bites that compound over time. Tonight, we're diving into the practical framework - the Four Laws of Behavior Change - starting with the first and most crucial law: Make it Obvious.

Because here's the truth: you can't eat an elephant you can't see."

**Body language:** Stand confidently, gesture toward the elephant emoji
**Visual cue:** Point to "Make it Obvious" subtitle

## Slide 2: Quick Bite-Sized Recap (45 seconds)

**What to say:**
"Let me quickly refresh your memory with the key bites from Session 1. Remember, your brain dedicates 80% of its energy to body budgeting - keeping you alive - leaving only 20% for conscious attention. This is why small 1% improvements work so well - they work WITH your brain's energy-conservation system, not against it.

We learned that these tiny improvements compound to create 37 times better results over a year. We discovered the power of focusing on systems rather than just goals, and most importantly, we learned to start with identity: 'Who am I becoming through this process?'

Every action you take is indeed a vote for your future self. Now, let's learn how to make those votes count by making them obvious."

**Delivery tips:**

- Quick, energetic pace to maintain momentum
- Emphasize "80%" and "20%" with gestures
- Pause after "vote for your future self"

## Slide 3: The Four Laws (45 seconds)

**What to say:**
"The Four Laws of Behavior Change give us a practical roadmap for eating any elephant. Think of them as your elephant-eating utensils, if you will. [gesture to each card]

Law 1: Make it Obvious - that's our focus today
Law 2: Make it Attractive - next session's delicious topic

Law 3: Make it Easy - we'll simplify the process
Law 4: Make it Satisfying - ensuring you enjoy every bite

Today we're mastering the first law because visibility is the foundation. You can have the most attractive, easy, and satisfying habit in the world, but if you can't see the opportunity to act on it, nothing happens."

**Movement:** Point to each law as you mention it

---

## Slide 4: The Habit Loop (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Before we dive into making things obvious, let's understand how every habit works. Every single habit - from brushing your teeth to checking your phone - follows this four-step pattern: Cue, Craving, Response, Reward.

The cue is your trigger - it could be a time, location, emotion, or another person. This creates a craving - the motivational force behind every habit. The craving leads to the response - the actual habit you perform. And finally, the reward - which satisfies the craving and teaches your brain to remember this loop for next time.

The First Law - Make it Obvious - directly addresses the cue. We're going to make your desired elephant bites so obvious that your brain can't help but notice the opportunity to act."

**Delivery tips:**

- Use hand gestures to show the flow from one step to the next
- Pause between each step for emphasis

---

## Slide 5: Law #1 Introduction (45 seconds)

**What to say:**
"Here's a startling fact: many of our most powerful habits are completely invisible to us. Research shows we operate on autopilot about 80% of the time - there's that 80% again! We're unconsciously following patterns we're not even aware we've created.

Awareness is the first step to change. Until you make the invisible visible, you're not really in control of your elephant-eating process. Clear cues create consistent actions. When you make your desired habits obvious, you give your brain clear instructions about when and where to act."

**Emphasis:** Really stress "invisible" and "obvious" - they're opposites

---

## Slide 6: The Problem - Invisible Habits (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Let me paint a picture of invisible habits that might sound familiar. How many times today did you check your phone without consciously deciding to do so? Did you mindlessly snack while watching TV last night? Have you been putting off that workout 'until tomorrow' for the past week? Or found yourself scrolling social media when you intended to read that book?

These aren't character flaws - they're invisible habits. Carl Jung said it perfectly: 'Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.'

We're not victims of fate. We're victims of invisible habits. But once we make them visible, we can change them."

**Delivery tips:**

- Make these examples relatable - pause to let people recognize themselves
- Slow down for the Carl Jung quote - make it profound

---

## Slide 7: The Habit Scorecard (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"This brings us to your first elephant-eating tool: the Habit Scorecard. This is step one in making your habits obvious - becoming aware of what you're already doing.

Look at this example. Starting from wake up, we list every single habit until noon, then rate each one. Plus for habits that help you become who you want to be - like brushing teeth and reading news. Minus for habits that hinder your progress - like checking your phone immediately upon waking or skipping breakfast. Equals for neutral habits that neither help nor hurt.

Here's your homework assignment: For the next three days, carry a small notebook. Write down every habit from the moment you wake up until noon. Don't judge them, just notice them. Rate each with a plus, minus, or equals.

You'll be amazed by what you discover. Most people find they have 20-30 unconscious habits before lunch alone!"

**Delivery tips:**

- Point to specific examples on the slide
- Make the homework assignment feel like an exciting challenge, not a chore

---

## Slide 8: Strategy 1 - Habit Stacking (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Now that you're aware of your current habits, let's use them as elephant-eating triggers. Habit stacking uses the psychology of existing habits to create new ones.

The formula is simple: After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]. You're essentially piggy-backing your new elephant bite onto an already established routine.

After I pour my morning coffee - that's your existing habit - I will read for 2 minutes. After I sit down at my desk, I will write one sentence. After I put on my running shoes, I will text my accountability partner.

The key is choosing a current habit that happens at the right frequency. If you want to read daily, don't stack it onto 'after I pay bills' because you don't pay bills daily. Stack it onto something you do every single day."

**Emphasis:** Use the formula structure to make it memorable

---

## Slide 9: Strategy 2 - Environmental Design (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Strategy two is my personal favorite: Environmental Design. You're going to become an architect of your own behavior by designing an environment that makes good habits obvious and bad habits invisible.

For good habits, make the cues unmissable. Put books on your pillow if you want to read before bed. Lay out your workout clothes the night before. Put healthy snacks at eye level in your fridge. Keep your guitar in the living room, not hidden in a closet.

For bad habits, hide the cues. Put junk food in hard-to-reach places. Charge your phone in another room at night. Uninstall social media apps and make accessing them require intentional effort. Remove the TV from your bedroom if you want better sleep.

Remember: small changes in context lead to large changes in behavior over time."

**Movement:** Use gestures to show "obvious" (hands up, open) vs "invisible" (hands down, closed)

---

## Slide 10: Strategy 3 - Implementation Intentions (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"The third strategy eliminates the vagueness that kills most elephant-eating attempts. Implementation Intentions force you to be specific about when and where you'll act.

Compare these two approaches: 'I will exercise more this week' versus 'I will exercise for 20 minutes by doing bodyweight exercises in my living room at 7am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.'

Which one sounds more likely to happen? The specific one, obviously! When you're specific, your brain knows exactly what to look for. Vague intentions leave too much room for your brain to say 'maybe later.'

The formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Fill in those blanks, and you've created a clear cue for action."

**Delivery tips:**

- Really contrast the vague vs specific examples with your tone
- Emphasize the word "specific" each time

---

## Slide 11: Elephant Bite Example (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Let me show you how all three strategies work together with a real elephant: reading more books. Many people want to read more, but they approach it like trying to swallow the elephant whole.

Instead, let's take obvious bites. Habit stacking: 'After I pour my morning coffee, I will read for 5 minutes.' Environmental design: 'I will put a book on my coffee table and hide my phone charger in another room.' Implementation intention: 'I will read for 5 minutes at 7am in my kitchen chair.'

Notice how we're not trying to read for an hour - that's too big a bite. Five minutes is obvious, manageable, and builds the identity: 'I am becoming a reader who starts each day with learning.'

This is how you eat the elephant of becoming well-read - one obvious, small, daily bite."

**Emphasis:** Show how the strategies build on each other

---

## Slide 12: Your Turn - Action Steps (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Now it's your turn to apply these elephant-eating strategies. Here's your action plan:

First, identify your elephant. What habit do you want to build? Be specific - not 'get healthy' but 'do 10 pushups daily.'

Second, choose your stack. What existing habit will trigger this new one? Pick something you already do consistently.

Third, design your environment. What cues will you make obvious? What obstacles will you remove?

Fourth, get specific. When exactly and where exactly will you act? No vagueness allowed.

And fifth, start tiny. What's the smallest first bite you can take? Remember, we're building the habit first, improving the performance later.

Every elephant is eaten one obvious, intentional bite at a time."

**Delivery tips:**

- Count on your fingers as you go through each step
- Make it feel achievable and exciting

---

## Slide 13: Next Session Preview (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
"Next week, we'll explore the Second Law: Make it Attractive. You'll learn how to make your elephant bites so irresistible that you'll actually crave taking them. We'll dive into the neuroscience of dopamine, discover temptation bundling strategies, and create compelling reasons to act.

Because let's face it - even the most obvious elephant bite won't happen consistently if it doesn't appeal to you."

**Tone:** Build excitement and curiosity

---

## Slide 14: Thank You (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
"I'll leave you with this thought: The most powerful way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.

So fellow Toastmasters, go make your next elephant bite obvious. Put that book on your pillow, lay out those workout clothes, write down those implementation intentions. Your future self will thank you for every obvious cue you create today.

Thank you, and I look forward to hearing about your elephant-eating progress!"

**Delivery:** Pause after the opening quote, then build energy toward the close
