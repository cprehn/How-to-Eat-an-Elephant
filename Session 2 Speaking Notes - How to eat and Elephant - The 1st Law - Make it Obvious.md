## Slide 1: Title Slide (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Welcome back, fellow elephant-eaters! I hope you've been thinking about your elephant since our last session. Quick show of hands - who tried implementing something from Session 1? Anyone notice any small habits they weren't aware of before?

Today we're diving into the first of James Clear's Four Laws of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious. Because here's the truth - you can't eat an elephant you can't see. 

By the end of today's session, you'll have three powerful tools to make your desired habits impossible to ignore and your unwanted habits much easier to avoid. We're going from awareness to action - from seeing your elephant clearly to taking that first deliberate bite."

**Body language:** Start with energy and connection, make eye contact, use gestures to show "seeing clearly"
**Visual cue:** Point to the elephant emoji and emphasize "seeing your next bite clearly"

## Slide 2: Quick Bite-Sized Recap (3 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Before we dive into making habits obvious, let's quickly refresh the foundation we built last session. These concepts are crucial for understanding why the first law works so powerfully.

Remember, your brain conserves energy - 80% body budgeting, 20% consciousness. Your brain wants you to be non-conscious most of the time to save energy. That's why small 1% improvements compound to 37 times better results over a year. Small bites, big results.

We focus on systems, not just goals. Goals tell us where to go, systems get us there. And we start with identity - 'Who am I becoming?' Because every action is a vote for your future self.

As I said last time: 'We are the habits we keep. We become what we repeatedly do.'

Now that we've refreshed our foundation, let's dive into how to make change obvious and unavoidable - because you can't take a bite of an elephant you can't see."

**Delivery tips:**
- Move through this quickly but clearly - it's a refresher, not new content
- Emphasize the 80/20 split and 37x improvement
- Use confident, building energy toward the new material

## Slide 3: The Four Laws of Behavior Change (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"James Clear identified four laws that govern all behavior change. Think of these as the complete recipe for eating any elephant. [point to each law as you mention it]

First: Make it Obvious - this is our focus today. You can't change what you can't see.
Second: Make it Attractive - next session, making your habits irresistible.
Third: Make it Easy - Session 4, removing friction and barriers.
Fourth: Make it Satisfying - Session 5, creating immediate rewards.

These four laws work together, but awareness - making it obvious - is where everything starts. You can't apply the other laws to habits you don't even realize you have.

How many of you have tried to change a habit but struggled with consistency? [pause for hands] The first law is often the missing piece."

**Movement:** Point to each law card as you mention it
**Emphasis:** Really stress "You can't change what you can't see"

## Slide 4: The Habit Loop (4 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Every habit - good or bad - follows this exact same pattern. Let me walk you through it with a simple example.

[Point to each step] First, the Cue - the trigger. Your phone buzzes. Second, the Craving - the motivation. You crave that dopamine hit of checking notifications. Third, the Response - the actual habit, the bite you take. You pick up your phone and check messages. Fourth, the Reward - the benefit that satisfies the craving. You get that satisfaction of being connected.

Here's the critical connection: The 1st Law - Make it Obvious - directly targets the CUE. [pause] If there's no clear cue, the habit loop never starts. If we can control the cues, we can control our habits.

Think of one habit you do regularly right now. Can you identify all four parts of your habit loop? [pause] The phone example probably felt familiar, didn't it?"

**Movement:** Walk along the habit loop diagram, pointing to each step
**Emphasis:** Stress "CUE" and pause after the critical connection
**Interaction:** Give them a moment to think about their own habit loop

## Slide 5: Law #1 Introduction - Make it Obvious (3 minutes)

**What to say:**
"[Point to the large '1' on screen] Law Number One: Make it Obvious. Here's why this is so crucial.

Many habits are invisible to us. We perform hundreds of habits daily without conscious thought. Quick question - how many times did you check your phone yesterday? [pause] Most people can't answer accurately.

Remember from last session - we operate on autopilot 80% of the time. We're only consciously aware of about 20% of our daily actions. The other 80% happens automatically.

Here's the key: Awareness is the first step to change. You cannot change what you do not notice. Awareness must come before action. Clear cues create consistent actions - when the trigger is obvious, the behavior follows naturally.

You can't eat an elephant you can't see. If your desired habit is invisible, you'll never consistently take bites.

How many of you have tried to build a habit but found yourself forgetting to do it? [show of hands] That's a cue problem, not a willpower problem."

**Emphasis:** Point to the big "1", stress the 80/20 split, pause after key insights
**Interaction:** Get them to raise hands about forgetting habits

## Slide 6: The Problem - Invisible Habits (3 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Let's look at some habits that are so automatic, we barely notice them. Raise your hand if you've ever picked up your phone without remembering why. [pause for hands] This happens because the cue - boredom, notification sound, even just seeing the phone - triggers an automatic response.

Or mindless snacking while watching TV. The TV becomes a cue for eating, even when you're not hungry. Putting off exercise 'until tomorrow' - the cue might be feeling tired, which triggers the 'I'll do it later' response. Scrolling social media instead of reading - you intend to read, but the phone is visible and social media is easier to access.

Carl Jung said it perfectly: 'Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.'

Take a moment and think: What's one habit you do regularly that you've never really thought about? [pause] These invisible patterns are running your life more than you realize.

So how do we make the invisible visible? That's where our first tool comes in."

**Delivery:** Get hands up for phone checking, pause for reflection moment
**Quote:** Slow down and emphasize the Jung quote - it's profound

## Slide 7: The Habit Scorecard (8 minutes)

**What to say:**
"The Habit Scorecard is your first weapon against invisible habits. Here's how it works.

[Point to the example] First, list every habit from wake-up until noon. Write down everything you do, no matter how small - wake up, check phone, brush teeth, make coffee, everything.

Second, rate each habit with a plus, minus, or equals. Plus means positive - helps you become who you want to be. Minus means negative - hinders your progress. Equals means neutral - neither helpful nor harmful.

Let's walk through the example: 'Wake up' equals neutral - you have to wake up. 'Check phone immediately' gets a minus - reactive start to your day. 'Brush teeth' gets a plus - good for health. 'Skip breakfast' gets a minus - impacts your energy.

I want everyone to try this right now. Take 3 minutes and list your morning habits from wake-up until noon. Don't think too hard - just write what you actually do, not what you think you should do. Go!"

**[Give them 3 minutes to work - walk around, encourage]**

"Time! Anyone surprised by how many habits you actually have? Did you discover any habits you weren't fully aware of? What patterns do you notice?

Remember: The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. This scorecard isn't about judgment - it's about awareness. You can't change what you don't see."

**Activity management:** Keep energy up during the exercise, walk around and engage
**Timing:** Use a timer, stick to 3 minutes for the activity

## Slide 8: Strategy 1 - Habit Stacking (5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Now that you're aware of your current habits, let's use them to build new ones. Habit stacking links your new elephant bite to an existing habit.

Here's the formula: 'After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit].' 

Why does this work? Your existing habits already have strong cues. You're borrowing the cue strength of established habits. It makes the new habit obvious because it's tied to something you already do.

Let me give you some examples: 'After I pour my morning coffee, I will read for 2 minutes.' Coffee is already a strong habit - now reading becomes automatic too.

'After I sit down at my desk, I will write one sentence.' You already sit at your desk - now writing gets triggered by that action.

'After I close my laptop, I will put my phone in another room.' Your end-of-work ritual triggers a digital boundary.

Think about your elephant - what habit do you want to build? What existing habit could you stack it onto? Turn to the person next to you and share your habit stack idea. Go!"

**[Give 2 minutes for partner discussion]**

"Three quick mistakes to avoid: Don't stack onto weak habits, make sure the timing makes sense, and start with tiny new habits."

**Movement:** Walk around during partner discussion
**Emphasis:** Really stress the formula - it's the key takeaway

## Slide 9: Strategy 2 - Environmental Design (4 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Your environment is constantly cueing behaviors. Let's design it intentionally. The core principle: Make the cues of good habits obvious and bad habits invisible.

[Gesture to left side] For good habits: Put books on your pillow - when you go to bed, you'll see the book. Lay out workout clothes - removes the friction of deciding what to wear. Put healthy snacks at eye level - what you see first is what you choose most often.

[Gesture to right side] For bad habits: Put junk food in the pantry - out of sight, out of mind. Charge your phone in another room - removes the visual cue for mindless scrolling. Uninstall social media apps - increase friction for time-wasting activities.

Here's the key insight: Your environment is voting for your habits every moment. Make sure it's voting for the right ones.

Look around this room right now. What habits is this environment encouraging? [pause] What would you change to support better habits?

Before our next session, I want you to make ONE environmental change. Make one good habit more obvious or one bad habit less visible."

**Movement:** Use the stage to show left/right contrast
**Challenge:** Make the homework commitment feel important

## Slide 10: Strategy 3 - Implementation Intentions (4 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Vague intentions lead to vague results. Implementation intentions make success obvious.

Bad example: 'I will exercise more this week.' This is too vague. When? Where? What kind of exercise? Your brain doesn't know what to do with this information.

Good example: 'I will exercise for 20 minutes by doing bodyweight exercises in my living room at 7am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.' This is specific. Your brain knows exactly what to do. The when, where, and what are all obvious.

Here's the formula: 'I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].'

Why does specificity work? It removes decision fatigue, creates clear mental triggers, eliminates ambiguity, and makes the habit obvious to your future self.

Take your habit stack from earlier and make it an implementation intention. Add the specific time and location.

Who wants to share their specific implementation intention? [get 2-3 examples from audience]

Research shows people who use implementation intentions are 2-3 times more likely to follow through on their goals."

**Interaction:** Get specific examples from audience and help refine them
**Formula emphasis:** Make sure they write down the formula

## Slide 11: Elephant Bite Example - Reading More (3 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Let's see how all three strategies combine for one common elephant: reading more.

[Point to each card] Habit Stacking: 'After I pour my morning coffee, I will read for 5 minutes.' Links to existing strong habit.

Environment: 'I will put a book on my coffee table and hide my phone charger.' Makes good habit obvious, bad habit invisible.

Implementation: 'I will read for 5 minutes at 7am in my kitchen chair.' Specific time, location, and duration.

And remember identity from last session: 'I am becoming a reader who starts each day with learning.'

Notice how these strategies reinforce each other. The coffee triggers the habit, the environment supports it, the implementation makes it specific, and the identity makes it meaningful.

Success factors: Start small - 5 minutes, not 30. Stack onto strong existing habit. Remove competing cues. Be specific about when and where.

What elephant could you apply this comprehensive approach to?"

**Movement:** Point to each strategy card as you explain it
**Integration:** Connect back to identity from Session 1

## Slide 12: Your Turn - Action Steps (6 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Now it's time to make YOUR elephant obvious. Work through these five steps:

First, identify your elephant - what habit do you want to build? Make it specific and small to start.

Second, choose your stack - what existing habit will trigger it? Pick something you do consistently every day.

Third, design your environment - what cues will you make obvious? What will you put in sight? What will you remove?

Fourth, get specific - when and where exactly will you act? Use that implementation intention formula.

Fifth, start tiny - what's the smallest first bite you can take? Two minutes of reading, not 30. One push-up, not 50.

Take 3 minutes and work through these steps. Write down your answers. Go!"

**[Give 3 minutes for individual work]**

"Find a partner and share your plan. Help each other make it more specific and obvious. Two minutes!"

**[2 minutes partner sharing]**

"Remember: Every elephant is eaten one obvious, intentional bite at a time. Who's willing to commit to trying their obvious habit for the next week?"

**Activity management:** Keep energy up, walk around during work time
**Commitment:** Get public commitments for accountability

## Slide 13: Next Session Preview (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Next week we're moving to the 2nd Law: Make it Attractive. We'll cover how to make your elephant bites irresistible, the role of dopamine in habit formation, temptation bundling strategies, and creating compelling reasons to act.

The 1st Law makes habits obvious, but the 2nd Law makes them irresistible. You'll learn how to hack your brain's reward system to make your habits so attractive, you'll crave the next bite!

Between now and next session, practice your obvious habit daily. Notice what works and what doesn't. We'll start next session by sharing successes and challenges."

**Tone:** Build excitement and anticipation for the next session

## Slide 14: Thank You (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"I'll close with my favorite quote about identity: 'The most powerful way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.'

Let me recap the key takeaways: Awareness comes before action. Use existing habits to build new ones. Design your environment intentionally. Be specific about when and where. Start small and obvious.

Make your next elephant bite obvious!

Before you leave today, commit to ONE thing you'll make obvious this week. Turn to someone near you and share it right now.

**[Give 30 seconds for quick sharing]**

Thank you for your engagement today, fellow elephant-eaters. Remember, every small bite counts, and every obvious cue is a step toward becoming who you want to be.

I'd love to hear your questions or thoughts about making your habits obvious."

**Final interaction:** Get them to share commitments with each other
**Energy:** End on a high, inspiring note
