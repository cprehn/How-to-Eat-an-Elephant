# Session 1: Speaking Notes V3 - How to Eat an Elephant... One Atomic Habit at a Time (1)

*Total Time: 9.5-11 minutes*

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
"Good morning, fellow Toastmasters and guests. How many of you have an elephant in your life right now? A big project, a life change, a goal that feels overwhelming? Today, I'm excited to share with you the first session of a five-part series based on James Clear's book 'Atomic Habits' - the revolutionary approach to building better habits through small, incremental changes. 

This isn't about dramatic overnight transformations. It's about something much more powerful - small changes that create remarkable results."

**Body language:** Stand confidently, make eye contact with different sections of the audience
**Visual cue:** Point to the elephant emoji on screen

## Slide 2: Your Brain's Hidden Agenda (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Before we dive into eating our elephant, I need to share something crucial from my previous presentation on Lisa Feldman Barrett's '7 & ½ Lessons About the Brain.' Your brain has a hidden agenda, and understanding it is key to why atomic habits work so well.

Here's the shocking truth: approximately 80% of your brain's function is dedicated to body budgeting - managing your heart rate, breathing, blood sugar, inflammation, and all the unconscious processes that keep you alive. That leaves only 20% for consciousness and attention - what we think of as 'us.'

Your brain's primary goal isn't to make you happy or successful - it's to keep you alive while spending as little energy as possible. That's why your brain wants you to be non-conscious most of the time. It's trying to conserve energy!

This is where habits become your superpower. The combination of attention and habits determines how much agency - how much real control - you have over your life. As the saying goes, 'We are the habits we keep' and 'We become the things we focus on.'

So when we talk about eating an elephant one atomic habit at a time, we're actually working WITH your brain's natural tendencies, not against them."

**Delivery tips:**

- Point to the percentages when mentioning them (80% and 20%)
- Emphasize "80%" and "20%" with vocal stress
- Pause after "only 20%" to let it sink in
- Use a more serious, educational tone for this foundational concept
- Gesture to show the contrast between the large 80% and smaller 20%

## Slide 3: Opening Hook - 1% Better (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Let me start with a question that will change your perspective on improvement. What if I told you that getting just 1% better each day - just one tiny bite of that elephant - could transform your life? [pause] It sounds almost too simple, doesn't it? But here's the math that will blow your mind.

If you improve by just 1% every single day for one year - that's 1.01 to the power of 365 - you don't end up 365% better. You end up 37 times better! That's a 3,700% improvement from tiny daily gains. That's how you eat the elephant - one small, consistent bite at a time."

**Emphasis:** Point to the formula, use hand gestures to show "tiny" vs "huge"
**Pause:** After revealing "37 times better" - let it sink in

---

## Slide 4: What Are Atomic Habits? (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"So what exactly are atomic habits? Think of them as the tiny bites of our elephant metaphor. The word 'atomic' means the smallest unit of a larger system. In chemistry, atoms are the building blocks of molecules. In habit formation, atomic means small and fundamental. [gesture to left side] These are tiny changes, marginal gains, those 1% improvements we just talked about.

But here's where the magic happens - [gesture to right side] habits compound. Just like those tiny bites eventually consume the entire elephant, these small actions compound into remarkable results through regular practice and automatic behaviors."

**Movement:** Use the stage to emphasize the two concepts, perhaps step left and right

---

## Slide 5: Why Small Changes Matter (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Now you might be thinking - why focus on small bites? Why not take huge chunks out of that elephant? Well, there are four powerful reasons. [count on fingers]

First, they're easy to start. When you want to read more, starting with 'read for 2 minutes' creates less resistance than 'read for an hour.' It's like taking a small, manageable bite instead of trying to swallow the whole trunk!

Second, they're sustainable. You're far less likely to burn out from doing 10 pushups a day than trying to do 100.

Third, there's that compound effect we just discussed - small bites eventually consume the entire elephant.

But here's the most important one - [pause] - they create an identity shift. When you consistently take those small bites, you start thinking 'I am the type of person who follows through.' James Clear puts it perfectly..."

**Read quote with emphasis:** "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

**Delivery tip:** Slow down for the quote, make it feel profound

---

## Slide 6: Goals vs Systems (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"This brings us to one of the most important distinctions in habit formation - goals versus systems. Most of us approach our elephant with goals. [gesture left] 'I'm going to eat this entire elephant by Friday!' But there's a problem with this approach.

Goals are outcome-based - you either ate the elephant or you didn't. They provide temporary motivation that fades. They create an all-or-nothing mindset, and they actually restrict your happiness until you finish that last bite.

Systems, on the other hand, [gesture right] focus on the process of eating. They're about continuous improvement. You get satisfaction from each bite, not just the final swallow.

Here's a simple example: If your goal is to lose 20 pounds, you're not successful until you lose all 20. But if your system is 'I eat a healthy breakfast every day,' you win every single morning - one bite at a time."

**Tone:** Slightly dismissive when discussing goals, enthusiastic about systems

---

## Slide 7: Valley of Disappointment (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Now, here's why most people abandon their elephant halfway through eating it, and it's not what you think. Most people give up in what James Clear calls the 'Valley of Disappointment.' [point to slide]

Picture this: You start taking bites of your elephant - maybe it's meditation, exercise, or learning a language. Week one, you're motivated. Week two, still going strong. But by week three or four, you're looking at this massive elephant thinking 'I've barely made a dent! This isn't working.'

But here's what's actually happening - your bites aren't wasted, they're accumulating. Think of an ice cube. You heat it from 26 degrees to 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 degrees - nothing happens. It's still ice. But at 32 degrees? [pause] Breakthrough! The ice melts.

Your habits work the same way. The breakthrough comes after you persist through the valley - when you realize you've actually accomplished more than you thought."

**Delivery:** Build tension, then release with the breakthrough moment

---

## Slide 8: Identity-Based Habits (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"This leads us to the most powerful concept in habit formation - identity-based habits. There are three levels of change, and most people start at the wrong level when approaching their elephant.

Most people start with outcomes - 'I want to eat this elephant, write a book, overcome stage fright.' Some people focus on process - 'I'm going to take 10 bites a day, write 500 words, practice speaking for 5 minutes daily.'

But the most effective approach starts with identity - 'Who do I want to become?'

Instead of 'I want to read more books,' ask 'Who am I becoming?' 

Answer: 'I want to be a reader.' Then ask, 'What would a reader do right now?' 

They'd probably put down their phone and pick up a book and read.

When you start with identity, every small bite reinforces who you're becoming. You're not just eating an elephant - you're becoming the type of person who finishes what they start."

**Emphasis:** Really stress the word "becoming" - it's about transformation

---

## Slide 9: Key Takeaways (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"Let me leave you with five key takeaways for eating your elephant: [count on fingers]

One - Focus on 1% improvements daily. Small bites compound.

Two - Build systems for consistent eating, not just elephant-finishing goals.

Three - Persist through the valley of disappointment. Your breakthrough is coming.

Four - Start with identity. Who do you want to become through this process?

And five - Remember that every small bite is a vote for your future self.

Which brings us to an exciting preview..."

**Delivery:** Confident, summarizing tone - this is what they should remember

---

## Slide 10: Next Session Preview (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
"In the coming weeks, we'll explore the practical framework—the Four Laws of Behavior Change. You'll learn exactly how to make your elephant-eating habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. So bring your elephant to the next session! You'll leave with a step-by-step system you can apply to any challenge in your life."

**Tone:** Build anticipation and curiosity

---

## Slide 11: Thank You (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
"I'll close with my favorite quote from James Clear: 'You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.'

So remember, fellow Toastmasters - when life presents you with an elephant, don't be overwhelmed by its size. Just grab your fork, take that first atomic bite, and trust the process.

Thank you for your attention tonight. I'd love to hear your questions or thoughts about the elephants in your own life."

**Delivery:** Pause after the quote, gesture to the elephant on screen, then open up warmly for questions

## General Speaking Tips:

### New Brain Science Integration:

- **Connect to previous presentation** - "As I mentioned in my previous talk..."
- **Use the 80/20 split as foundation** - refer back to this throughout
- **Emphasize working WITH the brain** rather than against it
- **Make body budgeting relatable** - "your brain is like a careful accountant"

### Elephant Metaphor Integration:

- **Use the metaphor naturally** - don't force it, but weave it throughout
- **Reference "bites" instead of just "steps"** when appropriate
- **Visual gestures** - make eating motions when discussing the process
- **Humor opportunities** - "Don't try to swallow the trunk first!"

### Timing Management:

- **Use a timer** - practice to stay within 9.5-11 minutes
- **If running long:** Skip the ice cube analogy or combine slides
- **If running short:** Add more elephant metaphor examples or expand on brain science

### Audience Engagement:

- **Ask about their elephants:** "What elephant are you facing right now?"
- **Reference the brain science:** "Remember, 80% of your brain wants you to conserve energy"
- **Use rhetorical questions:** "How many of you have an elephant you've been avoiding?"
- **Pause for effect** after revealing percentages and key statistics

### Vocal Variety:

- **Slow down** for important quotes and the brain science section
- **Speed up** during exciting parts (like the 37x improvement)
- **Lower voice** for intimate moments (identity discussion)
- **Raise energy** for takeaways and closing

### Recovery Strategies:

- **If you lose your place:** "Let me emphasize this key bite..."
- **If you skip content:** "The important thing to remember about eating elephants is..."
- **If technology fails:** Have key numbers memorized (80%, 20%, 1%, 37x, etc.)

### Toastmasters Specific:

- **Acknowledge the club** and the metaphor in opening: "Fellow elephant-eaters..."
- **Reference your previous presentation** to create continuity
- **Thank your evaluator** at the end
- **Use the lectern** if you prefer, but moving around adds energy
- **Project to the back row** - make sure everyone can hear about their elephants
